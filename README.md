# Team_Two

## Communication
We created a Slack group in order to communicate and share links with each other.  We also scheduled a Zoom session to meet on Sunday 4/16/23 in order to discuss where we are at with our project and what tasks we still need to accomplish so that we can get our Segment 1 Deliverable completed.
